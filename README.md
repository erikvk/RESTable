# What is RESTable?

RESTable is a REST API framework for .NET applications, that is free to use and easy to set up in new or existing applications. Its purpose is to provide a set of high-quality tools for developers to build great REST APIs, without having to deal with the complexities (and sometimes utter boringness) associated with client authentication, request processing, data integrations, performance optimizations, URI conventions and documentation.
