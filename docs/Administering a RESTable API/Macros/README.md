# Macros

Macros is a powerful feature of RESTable, that allows an administrator to create pre-defined requests that are used as syntactic templates, pre evaluation, to fill in properties for incoming API requests. Macros can be used to replace the URI, body or headers of calling requests.

They enable advanced use cases such as simplifying complicated and often repeated requests or enabling integration with REST clients that cannot make certain requests, etc. For more information, and how to manage Macros, see the documentation for the [`RESTable.Admin.Macro`](../../Built-in%20resources/RESTable.Admin/Macro) resource.
