# Administering a RESTable API

Apart from the usual tasks associated with running a web service, the task of administering a RESTable API can be defined as:

1. Setting up a [configuration file](../Configuration) that specifies [API keys](../ApiKeys) and allowed [CORS origins](../CORS), making sure that consumers have the right set of access privileges.
2. [Securing the REST API with HTTPS](../HTTPS) by, for example, setting up TLS encryption and firewall rules.
