# `Error`

```json
{
    "Name": "RESTable.Admin.Error",
    "Kind": "EntityResource",
    "Methods": ["GET", "DELETE", "REPORT", "HEAD"]
}
```

When the REST API aborts operations due to some error, information about the error is stored in the `Error` resource. `Error` entities contain information to help debug requests and resources, and are useful when encountering unknown errors. Erronous responses will contain a link to the corresponding `Error` entity in the `ErrorInfo` header for easy traceability.

## Example

Request:

```
GET https://my-server.com/rest/thisisnotaresource
Headers: "Authorization: apikey mykey"
```

Response:

```
Status code: 404 Not found
Headers:    "RESTable-info: RESTable could not locate any resource by 'thisisnotaresource'."
            "ErrorInfo: /RESTable.Admin.Error/id=EL5wa"
```

Error lookup request:

```
GET https://my-server.com/rest/RESTable.Admin.Error/id=EL5wa
Headers: "Authorization: apikey mykey"
```

Error lookup response body:

```
[
  {
    "Id": "EL5wa",
    "Time": "2018-02-09T13:11:14.2784921Z",
    "ResourceName": "<unknown>",
    "Action": "GET",
    "ErrorCode": "UnknownResource",
    "StackTrace": "   at RESTable.Resource.Find(String searchString)\r\n   at RESTable.Requests.Arguments.get_IResource()\r\n   at RESTable.Requests.RequestEvaluator.Evaluate(Action action, String& query, Byte[] body, Headers headers, TCPConnection tcpConnection) §§§ INNER: ",
    "Message": "RESTable could not locate any resource by 'thisisnotaresource'.",
    "Uri": "/thisisnotaresource/_/_",
    "Headers": "Connection: Keep-Alive | Accept: */* | Authorization: apikey ******* | Host: demo-dsp.mopedo-drtb.com:8282 ... ",
    "Body": null,
    "ObjectNo": 70229018
  }
]
```

The `StackTrace` is useful to include in bug reports to developers. Also, note that the API key is hidden in the `Headers` property.
