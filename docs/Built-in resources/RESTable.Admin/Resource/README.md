# `Resource`

```json
{
    "Name": "RESTable.Admin.Resource",
    "Kind": "EntityResource",
    "Methods": ["GET", "PATCH", "REPORT", "HEAD"]
}
```

`Resource` is a meta-resource that contains entities that correspond to the resources currently registered in the REST API. All resources have a `Resource` entity describing it.

**To get all resources currently registered by the server:**

```
GET https://my-server.com/rest/resource
Headers: 'Authorization: apikey mykey'
```

**To list all resource names only:**

```
GET https://my-server.com/rest///select=name
Headers: 'Authorization: apikey mykey'
```

## Adding resources

Resources can be added during runtime by calling any procedural resource controller, for example the built-in [`RESTable.Dynamic.Resource`](../../RESTable.Dynamic) resource.
